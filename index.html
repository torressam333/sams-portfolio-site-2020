            <p>In the past three years I have acquired practical working knowledge as a software developer.
                My experience is rooted in an educational background in computer science as well as enterprise level
                full-stack development experience. The skills listed below are a few of the languages, technologies
                and technical tooling in which I am able to proficiently use and implement.

                <hr class="expand-line">
                <p>When first learning to code my primary OS was Windows. I wanted to work more with system
                    administration
                    and also become more comfortable with the Command Line so I dual booted my laptop to have both
                    Windows
                    and Ubuntu installed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I end up using Ubuntu 99% of the time and command line has become one of my greatest
                    assets. Now I use the command line for almost everything: from installing packages, sifting through
                    error log data, setting up a native LAMP stacks with multiple versions of PHP running,
                    and keeping my OS updated/upgraded.

                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <hr class="expand-line">
                <p>My preferred server side language is PHP: v5 & v7+. Along with this I am well versed in using
                    Laravel v5.7 and v6+.</p>
                <p>For client side development I am proficient in vanilla javascript, both es5 and more modern es6
                    functionality.</p>
                <p>I have worked plenty with jquery, CSS3, HTML5 as well as templating technologies such as Pug and
                    Laravel Blade.</p>
                <p>I am familiar with Vue.js, node.js, Bootstrap 4 and Sass.</p>
                <p>I have worked with Ajax and building out RESTful Api's both natively and in Laravel using JSON as
                    the data source.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>Tooling/Debugging</h2>
                <hr class="expand-line">
                <p>Having the proper tooling and skills to debug applications is equally as important as knowing
                    a language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For development I have used an array of different code editors and IDE's. For simple projects I
                    prefer
                    VS Code but my main IDE is PHP Storm. For debugging I prefer to use xdebug. I don't know how I ever
                    programmed without it. Stepping through code and figuring out what is being outputted is helpful in
                    finding code issues as well as understanding code logic and flow.
                </p>
                <p>Another set of tools I use are the Chrome DevTools, particularly for debugging Javascript code.
                    Along with the many development extensions offered by Chrome, I also utilize the Vue dev tools
                    within the Chrome console.

                <h2>Databases & SQL</h2>
                <hr class="expand-line">
                <p>The use of SQL and databases is crucial for any developers toolkit. I mostly work with relational
                    databases including MySQL and SQL Server (MSSQL) for all of my applications. Everything from DDL:
                    creating databases, schemas, tables to using DML to manipulate data: Selecting,
                    inserting deleting or any other form of data manipulation, I use them daily in my professional and
                    personal applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the Laravel world I am versed in writing Database migrations for table creation and
                    updating data. When working with data my DB client of choice would be mysql workbench or DBeaver
                    when
                    working in Ubuntu, otherwise in Windows I like to use HeidiSQl.

                    <li>For VCS I used Mercurial for a brief period but mostly use GIT and Github Repositories. Along
                        with
                        Github I do most of my commands from the CLI but also use GitKraken if I ever need a good
                        GIT GUI. I am comfortable merging, creating branches, rebasing, cherry picking, committing
                        and pushing to git repo's.

                    <li>
                        I have knowledge of AWS concepts and services that Amazon offers. I have worked with Elastic
                        Beanstalk deployments, setting up and ssh-ing in EC2 instances and creating and
                        querying DynamoDB tables. I have more-so theoretical knowledge of various AWS services.

                    <li>I am familiar with open SSH as well as some networking concepts including: tunneling
                        DNS configurations, ip forwarding and port forwarding.
                    </li>
                    <li>For continuous deployment I use Drone and corresponding drone yaml files

                    </li>
                    <li>I am comfortable using npm and composer and installing front-end and back-end packages and

            <p>I have three years of software development experience. My professional experience consists of working for
                a large non-profit organization. I am proficient in building out and maintaining full fledged web
                applications
                consisting of both server side and client side development. I mostly work with native PHP and frequently
                use Laravel's PHP framework.</p>
            <p>I love building out applications, tackling difficult tasks and using logic and analytical processes to
                produce and implement efficient coding solutions.
            </p>
            <p>Personally and professionally, I am a diligent and self motivated individual.
                I am an innate leader who also enjoys collaborating and working with others.
                I am articulate, concise and pragmatic when solving any complications whether technical or relating to
                the overall business.
            </p>
            <p>Regardless of the experience I have gained, I understand that there is plenty more to learn. The
                un-ending
                challenges and continuous learning are just a couple of reasons why I enjoy working in the software
                development field.
